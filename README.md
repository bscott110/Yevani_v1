Just a simple website that I agreed to assist a homie with. It's essentially an e-commerce clothing store.

-Progress so far-

1.basic landing page- company logo in top left, navbar with buttons to respective pages, mouse color hover-since company logo uses a white and black color scheme, the cleanest look to me would be a white background with black text.

2.homepage with slideshow gallery for images. onclick,photo enlarges with textbar for item name and price.

3.added links to all present buttons and added headers to the about/shop pages
