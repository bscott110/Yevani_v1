These bitch-ass corporations dont want to give entry level devs a chance with a reasonable salary. Fuck you, I'll just front-end freelance til I get what I want.


This is a simple, front-end website that I agreed to assist a homie with. It's essentially an e-commerce clothing store.

-Progress so far-

1.basic landing page- company logo in top left, navbar with button to respective pages, mouse color hover-since company logo uses a white and black color scheme, the cleanest look to me would be a white background with black text.
